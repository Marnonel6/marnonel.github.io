# **About Me**

<font size="+1">
<!-- Hi, I am <b>Jiasen (Jason) Zheng</b> :wave:.<br> -->

Hi, I am <b>Marthinus (Marno) Nel</b>
  
IÂ graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Robotic/Mechatronic, Mechanical and Electronic, Engineering from Stellenbosch University in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

In my final year I was required to generate, design and build a working project and write an undergraduate thesis.  My thesis was approved at the end of 2021 with the title "Design and build a Thrust vector controlled model rocket" and it was inspired by a fellow South Africa, Elon Musk. I achieved a Cum Laude grade for my thesis and won an award.

My main interests in robotics are: Autonomous Vehicle, UAVs, Embedded systems, SLAM, Path planning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision,  Automation,  Control systems design.

Through the MSR program, I look forward to joining the robotics industry and <b>pushing the boundaries of ROBOTICS!</b>
