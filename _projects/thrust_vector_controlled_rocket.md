# Autonomous airhockey robot

### Brief overview
<br>
Invented, built, and tested a thrust vector controlled scaled rocket for my undergraduare thesis in mechatronic engineering. I implemented a PID controller and a state machine in C++ for autonomous active orientation control in-flight and recovery. I formulated and constructed a custom flight controller PCB using EAGLE. Designed the rocket body, thrust vector control mount and parachute deploy system in Inventor/Fusion360. A autonomous launchpad and App was built to launch the rocket from a safe distance. A ESP32 was used for wireless protocols between the launchpad and the android app created with MIT AppInventor.

(Final thesis is attatched below.)
